# Algorithms, DataStructures and Design Patterns

Repository is simply named Algorithms, but there will be also a design patterns section. Planning to implement the most common used data structures and algorithms in order to understand more what I use every day and how does it work. Beside algorithms and data structures, I am planning to implement commonly used design patterns. Implementations will be written mostly in C++ and C#, in future maybe in F#. 

### Currently implemented
* Singly-linked list
* Doubly-linked list
* Sorting algorithms
* "Ad hoc" problems (Fibonacci sequence, simple string parsing, some COCI rounds tasks - problems )
* __Queue, Stack, Deque, RandomizedQueue__
* __Math expression calculator__ (infix to postfix conversion, calculating postfix expression in imperative and functional way)
* Towers of Hanoi problem
* Directory Tree, BFS, DFS traversal
* Minimal average subarray
* NokiaComposer parser and sound producer
* Search Query parser based on simple grammar
* Let computer generate random number in [0,100] and develop algorithm which guesses generated number in less or equal to 7 steps
* __Dynamic connectivity problem__ -> various union find algorithms
* Collinear points Bruteforce and Optimized(n2 log n) solution
* __Backtracking problems__ -> N Queens problem, Knight's tour problem, Rat in a maze problem, Word break problem (without DP and with DP), Searching for a word in letters matrix, Sudoku (9 * 9) solver, Magic Square (3x3) generator
* __Graph problems__ -> Topological sort problems, Bipartitive testing problems, Longest path problems, Maze problems, Graph searching and coloring problems
* __Greedy problems__ -> Greedy iterative activity selection problem, job scheduling with max profit and deadline


### Algorithm and DS Competition solutions
* __COCI 2016/2017__ round 1 Jetpack task
* __COCI 2016/2017__  round 2 first six tasks
* __COCI 2016/2017__  round 4 problems
* First 10 __Advent of Code 2016__ problems

### Will be implemented
* Various graph problems
* Various dynamic programming problems
* Interesting COCI (Croatian open informatics competition) or SPOJ problems
* Common DesignPatterns like AbstractFactory, Command, Strategy, Decorator, Iterator, Singleton and ...

# Algorithms

My personal algorithms and data structures practice. Planning to implement the most common used data structures and algorithms in order to understand more what I use every day and how does it work. Implementations will be written mostly in C++ and C#, in future maybe in F#. 

### Currently implemented
* Singly-linked list
* Doubly-linked list
* Sorting algorithms
* "Ad hoc" problems (Fibonacci sequence, simple string parsing, ...)
* Stack, Math expression calculator (infix to postfix conversion)

### Will be implemented
* Queue
* Trees
* Graphs

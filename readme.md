# Algorithms, DataStructures and Design Patterns

Repository is simply named Algorithms, but there will be also a design patterns section. Planning to implement the most common used data structures and algorithms in order to understand more what I use every day and how does it work. Beside algorithms and data structures, I am planning to implement commonly used design patterns. Implementations will be written mostly in C++ and C#, in future maybe in F#. 

### Currently implemented
* Singly-linked list
* Doubly-linked list
* Sorting algorithms
* "Ad hoc" problems (Fibonacci sequence, simple string parsing, ...)
* Queue, Stack, Math expression calculator (infix to postfix conversion, calculating postfix expression)
* Towers of Hanoi problem
* Directory Tree, BFS, DFS traversal, 

### Will be implemented
* Graphs, graph algorithms and common algorithms like shortest/longest paths, graphs, traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS)
